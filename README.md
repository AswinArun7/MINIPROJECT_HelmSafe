# 🪖 HelmSafe – Smart Helmet for Road Safety

## 📌 Project Overview

HelmSafe is a **Smart Helmet system** designed to enhance two-wheeler road safety by preventing unsafe riding conditions and enabling faster emergency response. The system ensures that the rider wears a helmet, is not under the influence of alcohol, and receives timely help during accidents.

This project focuses on **accident prevention, responsible riding, and rider safety** using embedded systems and IoT concepts.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Helmet Presence Detection**
  Ensures the vehicle ignition works only when the helmet is worn.

* **Alcohol Detection**
  Prevents vehicle ignition if alcohol is detected in the rider’s breath.

* **Accident Detection & SOS Alert (Without GSM)**
  Detects accidents and triggers emergency alerts without relying on GSM connectivity.

* **Real-Time Safety Monitoring**
  Continuously monitors rider safety conditions through integrated sensors.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino UNO
* **Sensors:**

  * MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor
  * Reed Switch (Helmet Detection)
  * MPU6050 (Accident Detection)
* **Programming Language:** Embedded C / Arduino
* **Mobile App:** Flutter (for alerts and data display)

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Helmet presence is verified before ignition.
2. Alcohol level is checked after helmet confirmation.
3. Accident detection continuously monitors rider movement.
4. In case of an accident, SOS alerts are triggered for immediate assistance.
